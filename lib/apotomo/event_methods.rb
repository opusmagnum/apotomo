    # Instructs the widget to look out for <tt>type</tt> Events that are passing by while bubbling.
    # If an appropriate event is encountered the widget will send the targeted widget (or itself) to another
    # state, which implies an update of the invoked widget.
    #
    # You may configure the event handler with the following <tt>options</tt>:
    #  :with  => (optional) the state to invoke on the target widget, defaults to +type+.
    #  :on    => (optional) the targeted widget's id, defaults to <tt>self.name</tt>
    #  :from  => (optional) the source id of the widget that triggered the event, defaults to any widget
    #
    # Example:
    #   
    #   trap = widget(:trap, :charged, 'mouse_trap')
    #   trap.respond_to_event :mouseOver, :with => :catch_mouse
    #
    # This would instruct +trap+ to catch a <tt>:mouseOver</tt> event from any widget (including itself) and
    # to invoke the state <tt>:catch_mouse</tt> on itself as trigger.
    #
    #   
    #   hunter = widget(:form, :hunt_for_mice, 'my_form')
    #     hunter << widget(:input_field, :smell_like_cheese,  'mouse_trap')
    #     hunter << widget(:text_area,   :stick_like_honey,   'bear_trap')
    #   hunter.respond_to_event :captured, :from => 'mouse_trap', :with => :refill_cheese, :on => 'mouse_trap'
    #
    # As both the bear- and the mouse trap can trigger a <tt>:captured</tt> event the later <tt>respond_to_event</tt>
    # would invoke <tt>:refill_cheese</tt> on the <tt>mouse_trap</tt> widget as soon as this and only this widget fired.
    # It is important to understand the <tt>:from</tt> parameter as it filters the event source - it wouldn't make
    # sense to refill the mouse trap if the bear trap snapped, would it?
